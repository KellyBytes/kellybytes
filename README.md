# 👋 Hi, I'm Kelly

I'm passionate about crafting accessible, engaging web experiences with precision and creativity.
With a background in mechanical engineering and technical translation, I bring a unique analytical and detail-oriented approach to problem-solving and design.

I'm experienced with modern front-end technologies and frameworks, and I'm currently expanding into full-stack development to better understand end-to-end workflows. 
I'm a quick learner and adaptable self-starter, always focused on building intuitive interfaces, adding new features, and improving existing projects through debugging, optimization, and accessibility enhancements.

I enjoy transforming complex ideas into intuitive, user-centered interfaces and continuously sharpening my skills through hands-on projects.
